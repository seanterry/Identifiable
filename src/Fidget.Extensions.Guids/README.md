# Fidget.Extensions.Guids
Extension methods for working with GUIDs.

### Sequential GUIDs
Random GUIDs have [well-known weaknesses](http://www.informit.com/articles/printerfriendly/25862) when used in clustered indexes. In his article, Jimmy Nilsson describes a hybrid GUID structure called a COMB, which writes the database server's current time into the highest-order bits of a random GUID to make them semi-sequential.

The `Sequentialize` extension method implements the COMB concept with the following advantages:
* Generated by the application, rather than the database server.
* Auto-generated sequence values meet the requirements for use in a UUIDv1 Timestamp as described in [RFC 4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122#section-4.1.4).
* Auto-generated sequence values are not re-used by the same process, they will still increment even if the system clock has not advanced.
* You may supply your own sequence value, rather than using an auto-generated one.
* SQL Server formatted values are optimized for use in clustered indexes in that DBMS.

Disclaimers:
* The generated values are not real GUIDs. They are hybrids, and while they have a sufficently small collision domain for use as surrogate keys in your database, I recommend generating a real name-based GUID from a cryptographic hash for publicly exposed values.
